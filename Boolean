//Coding in function trueOrFalse, function accept 1 parameters:val, try to use the conditional statement if...else, if val value is false (val==false or it can convert to false), should return a string "false", if not, return a string "true".

function trueOrFalse(val){
  if (val==false||val==0||val==-0||val==''||val==null||val==undefined||val==NaN)    return 'false';             
  else     return 'true';
}

1)                                                        Understanding Boolean Values
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.

Tests
Waiting:The welcomeToBooleans() function should return a Boolean (true or false) value.
Waiting:welcomeToBooleans() should return true.

function welcomeToBooleans() {
  // Only change code below this line

  return true || false; // Change this line

  // Only change code above this line
}

2)                                                Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
test(true) returns the string It was true, and test(false) returns the string It was false.

When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns It was true. When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns It was false.

Create an if statement inside the function to return Yes, that was true if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return No, that was false otherwise.

Tests
Waiting:trueOrFalse should be a function
Waiting:trueOrFalse(true) should return a string
Waiting:trueOrFalse(false) should return a string
Waiting:trueOrFalse(true) should return the string Yes, that was true
Waiting:trueOrFalse(false) should return the string No, that was false

function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (wasThatTrue) {
    return 'Yes, that was true'
  }
  return 'No, that was false'
  // Only change code above this line

}

3)                                Comparison with the Equality Operator
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return Equal. Otherwise, the function will return Not Equal. In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true
Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return the string Equal when val is equivalent to 12.

Tests
Waiting:testEqual(10) should return the string Not Equal
Waiting:testEqual(12) should return the string Equal
Waiting:testEqual("12") should return the string Equal
Waiting:You should use the == operator

// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
  if (val == 12 || val == '12') { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

testEqual(10);
